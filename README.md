# Filmatic

Filmatic shows you some popular movies of the moment. The project is a playground application that I use 
to catch up with modern Android development. In particular, I've used it to learn modularization and 
Dependency Injection with [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/) and then [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/).

## Modular Architecture üß©

As mentioned, the app uses a multi-modular project structure. A module can be of 3 different types:

- Library module
- Feature module
- App Module

</div>

A **library module** can be an Android or a pure Kotlin module. A library module never depends on a feature or an app module, 
but it can depend on another library. Library modules can contain different functionalities, for example 
UI components, data storage, networking, analytics, etc.

A **feature module** is an Android library that contains a specific feature of the app. For example,
the onboarding flow, the home screen, the settings, etc. A feature module never depends on other feature modules 
or on an app module. However, it depends on many libraries module

The **app module** is an Android Application and it links all the modules together. For that reason it 
depends on other feature and library modules.

Filmatic is composed of different feature and library modules:

- **App module** -> wraps all the modules together and decides which activity to start
- **buildSrc**  -> contains the definitions of the dependencies used in the project
- **core**      -> contains common code used around the app, plus the localized strings.
- **Feature modules**: 
    - **about** -> contains the code for the about screen
    - **home**  -> contains the code for the home screen
- **Library modules**:
    - **navigation**    -> handles navigation between different feature modules. The navigation is handled with implicit intents
    - **preferences**   -> retrieve and store data from shared preferences
    - **test-shared**   -> contains common test utilities used in different feature modules
    - **ui-components** -> contains the UI components used in the app, plus style, colors and common drawables
   

## Feature module architecture üèó

Every feature module is structured using Clean Architecture, with [data](https://github.com/prof18/Filmatic/tree/master/features/home/src/main/java/com/prof18/filmatic/features/home/data),
[domain](https://github.com/prof18/Filmatic/tree/master/features/home/src/main/java/com/prof18/filmatic/features/home/domain)
and [presentation](https://github.com/prof18/Filmatic/tree/master/features/home/src/main/java/com/prof18/filmatic/features/home/presentation) layers.  

Dependency Injection is managed with [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/).

## Automations ü§ñ

The projects is using [**detekt**](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) for formatting and static analysis.

There is also a GitHub Action, named [Code Checks](https://github.com/prof18/Filmatic/blob/master/.github/workflows/checks.yaml) that builds and runs the `check` gradle task. 

## Build and Run üíª

To build and run the app, you have to set a secret in your local.properties file, for the TMDB API.

```
tmdbKey=YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY
```

Or as an alternative, you can set it as system environment variables: `TMDB_KEY`

N.B. The system environment variable is mandatory to make the CI work.
